## BioStatistics Boot Camp
* Two weeks to complete each of the modules, with only one week for the 4th module. Take the quizzes, which is the basis of the grade. Do the homework if you want, but it doesn't count.
* There is a Git repository with sample code to play with
* Biostatistics is a theory and methodology for the acquisition and use of quantitative eidence in biomedical research. Biostatisticians devep innovative designs and analytic mehtods targeted at increasing available information, improving the relevance and validity of statistical analysis, making best use of availbale information and communicating relevant uncertainties.
** Johns Hopkins Department of Biostatistics 2007 self study
* Existing clinical practice is occasionally changed based on emperical evidence. (hormone replacement theropy is a bad thing) There was a statistically based protocol where they decided whether to continue the study based on the excessive number of negative results.
* Tricky if the trial is considered so beneficial that it would be unethical to deny the trial therapy, and then when you never give it your statistics are bad.
* Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Pholosohy
** Tight coupling of statitistical methods with ethical and scientific goals
** Ephasizing scientific interpretation of statistical evidence to impact policy
** Acknowledging  assumptions and evaluation the robustness of conclusions to them
* Experiment
** Collection of measurements from a sample population
** measurements from a laboratory experiment
** result of a clinical trial
** result of a computer simulation
** values from hospital records sampled retrospectively
